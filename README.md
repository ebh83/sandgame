# Powder Toy

A satisfying falling sand simulation where particles interact, react, and create chaos! Inspired by classic powder games, with fire, water, explosions, and chemical reactions.

## Materials

### Basics
- **Sand** - Falls and piles up naturally
- **Water** - Flows and spreads, extinguishes fire
- **Stone** - Solid, immovable, fireproof
- **Eraser** - Remove any material

### Nature
- **Wood** - Solid and flammable
- **Plant** - Grows when watered!
- **Ice** - Freezes nearby water, melts near heat

### Fire & Heat
- **Fire** - Burns flammable materials, rises
- **Lava** - Hot liquid that ignites things and turns to stone when cooled
- **Oil** - Flammable liquid, burns spectacularly
- **Gunpowder** - EXPLOSIVE! Keep away from fire... or don't 💥

### Special
- **Acid** - Dissolves almost everything it touches
- **Salt** - Dissolves in water
- **Steam** - Rises from heated water
- **Smoke** - Rises from burning materials

## Reactions

| Combination | Result |
|------------|--------|
| Fire + Wood | More fire! |
| Fire + Oil | Big fire! |
| Fire + Gunpowder | EXPLOSION! |
| Lava + Water | Stone + Steam |
| Fire/Lava + Ice | Water |
| Water + Plant | Plant grows |
| Water + Salt | Salt dissolves |
| Ice + Water | Water freezes |
| Acid + Almost anything | Dissolves it |
